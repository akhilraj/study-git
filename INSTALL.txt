INSTALLATION
------------

Zend Framework requires no special installation steps. Simply download the framework,
extract it to the folder you would like to keep it in, and add the library directory
to your PHP include_path. To use components in the extras library, add the extras/library
directory to your PHP include_path, as well.
If you would like to use Zend_Tool, simply add bin/zf.bat (for Windows) or
bin/zf.sh (for anything else) to your system executable path.
